Description:
Exploratory data analysis of social media habits and stress levels using public dataset!

Research Question:
How do breaks from social media affect stress levels?

Methods:
   - loaded dataset with pandas
   - made variables for break frequency
   - checked assumptions (normality, Levene test)
   - ran independent samples t-tests

Tools:
Python, pandas, SciPy, matplotlib (analysis in a Jupyter-style Kaggle notebook)

Conclusion:
People who took more breaks had slightly lower stress levels, but the findings were not statistically significant.
